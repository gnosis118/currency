# Google Indexing Issues Analysis

## Common Causes of Pages Not Being Indexed (2025)

Based on recent research, here are the main reasons pages aren't indexed by Google:

### 1. **Google's June 2025 Update Impact**
- Many sites experienced deindexing after Google's June 2025 core update
- Google has been more selective about which pages to index
- "Crawled - Currently Not Indexed" status has increased significantly

### 2. **Technical Issues**
- **Robots.txt problems**: Blocking important pages or resources
- **Missing sitemap reference**: Sitemap not declared in robots.txt
- **Noindex tags**: Accidentally blocking pages from indexing
- **Server issues**: Crawling problems or slow response times
- **Blocked CSS/JS**: Preventing proper page rendering

### 3. **Content Quality Issues**
- **Low-quality content**: Pages deemed not valuable enough to index
- **Duplicate content**: Similar content across multiple pages
- **Thin content**: Pages with insufficient content
- **Poor page structure**: Missing proper headings, meta tags

### 4. **Sitemap Issues**
- **Outdated sitemap**: Not reflecting current site structure
- **Incorrect URLs**: Broken or redirected URLs in sitemap
- **Missing pages**: Important pages not included in sitemap
- **Large sitemaps**: Too many URLs causing processing issues

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Check robots.txt file**
2. **Verify sitemap.xml structure and submission**
3. **Analyze page quality and content**
4. **Review technical SEO elements**
5. **Submit pages for reindexing**
